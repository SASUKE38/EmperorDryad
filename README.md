The Emperor in Zethino's Love Test Mod for Baldur's Gate 3
=======

## Release
* [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12966)

## About
This mod allows the player to do Zethino's love test in the Circus of the Last Days with the Emperor if his romance arc was completed. Most answers to the second question can only be unlocked after learning about the Emperor's past.

## Installation
The mod can be installed with the in-game mod manager by placing the .pak file in your \AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods folder and then activating it in-game.
The Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager should work as well.

## Known Issues
- Some dialog animations have strange, sudden head movements. This love test is very different for the Emperor, and he isn't always sure what to make of it.
- The Emperor slides back when he stops moving forward on a successful test. He wasn't paying attention to where he was going and accidentally got too close, so he wants to quickly get to a safe distance.
- Hirelings must be in camp to do the test, while other companions need only be far enough away from Zethino. The Emperor doesn't trust Withers to not pry.
